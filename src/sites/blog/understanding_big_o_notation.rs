                is more efficient than algorithm B. There's more to it. The reason is this: Big
                O notation, as described in the start, is the behavior of a value (n) as it
                reaches infinity (or in mathematical notation that'd be: n → ∞). This specific
                notation eliminates all constant values in its determination. This means that
                O(2n) is portrayed as O(n) (linear), just in the same way that O(1,000n) is
                portrayed as O(n), so is O(1,000,000n) and so on. The reason for this is
                because big O notation was meant to only account for the worst case scenario of
                an algorithm. That worst case scenario being the upper limit of n as it reaches
                infinity, and because it's only looking at that, it removes all other constants
                because eventually n will be greater than them. But is this true in practice?
                In most cases it's not, some of the times you even know your exact data set as
                well! That means that you can optimize an algorithm based exactly on that data

                {"The big O notation is a mathematical way to define the worst case scenario
                performance of an algorithm as its data set reaches infinity. This means it
                evaluates its performance based on the upper bound of the data set. The performance
                measured is separated in 2 types: runtime performance (how much your CPU needs to
                operate on the data set) and memory performance (how much runtime memory your
                algorithm takes based on your data set). Determining which part of your program you
                want to optimize depends heavily on your use case. You have to evaluate which one
                is the better one to optimize for. Also, Big O notation is for the worst case
                scenarios, there's also Big Ω (Omega) notation for the best case scenarios (where
                your constant that operates on the data set is less than or equal to your functions
                input) and a Big Θ (Theta) notation where your growth rate has to be even
                throughout the growth of your data set. This means that everything that can be
                described in Big Theta can also be described in Big Omega and Big O notations."}
